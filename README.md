# CS 471 - Operating Systems
## Old Dominion University - Fall '22

This repo contains the programming homework for CS 471 Operating Systems taken 
at Old Dominion Univeristy during the Fall semester of 2022.

I enjoyed this class because I got to get a little more familiar with C, and I
challenged myself to implement some of the techniques described in the textbook
(Silberschatz, etc.). Two of the most challenging implementations are linked
below; please have a look!
